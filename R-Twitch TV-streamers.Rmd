# 1. Introduction

The project revolves around the examination of the top 5 most popular streamers on the Twitch TV platform. Various elements are being analyzed, including:
Total Followers,
Watch Time,
Languages,
Followers Gained.

# 2. Loading packages and data.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse, scales)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(viridisLite)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotrix)

streamers <- read.csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/MUSIALBAR/a0d6d4d37f89ab795a02aebfafbcf37e/raw/a9ed5d2c72dce4f3984ba91bac22530e8de80946/twitch?fbclid=IwAR0h6ywiOnPL681kInhSnSllyWo_C5c9rDIApN2Xc-FdAzzMHRgIpcl7890")

```

### 2.1 Data modification.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

#Changing column names.

new_word <- c("channel", "watch_time", "stream_time", "peak_viewers", "average_viewers", "total_followers", "followers_gained", "views_gained", "partnered", "mature", "language")
colnames(streamers) <- new_word

#Removing unnecessary column.

streamers <- subset(streamers, select = -mature)

#Adding an additional column named "rank".

streamers <- cbind(rank = seq(1, 1000), streamers)
```

### 2.2 Variable overview.

Each time value is expressed in minutes.

Rank: this variable indicates the position or ranking of the channel on the list of the top 1000 channels on the Twitch TV platform. A lower number signifies a higher position in the ranking.

Channel: this variable represents the registered channel name on the Twitch TV platform, allowing for the unique identification of each channel.

Watch_time (minutes): the variable represents the cumulative time, in minutes, that users have spent watching content on the Twitch platform.

Stream_time (minutes): refers to the total duration, in minutes, during which a streamer has been actively broadcasting content on a platform, such as Twitch. This metric captures the overall length of time a streamer has been live and engaging with their audience.

Peak_viewers: it typically refers to the maximum number of concurrent viewers reached during a live stream or a specific time period

Average_viewers: it represents the mean or average number of people watching a live stream at any given moment over a defined period, such as an entire stream session, an hour, or a day.

Total_followers: refers to the complete count of followers that a channel has amassed from its inception or start date until the current point in time.

Followers_gained: this metric measures the growth of a channel's audience during the specified one-year period.

Views_gained: refers to the total number of views that a channel or content creator has accumulated over the course of a specific one-year period.

Partnered: refers to a special partnership program offered to selected and trusted content creators. Being a Twitch partner means that a particular channel has met specific criteria and gained access to various benefits and tools that support its growth.

Language: refers to the primary language in which a content creator conducts their live broadcasts or streams.



# 3. Total Followers - For The Top 5 Twitch TV Streamers.

I am narrowing down the dataset to the top 5 most popular streamers on the Twitch TV platform in terms of Total Followers.

```{r}

top_5 <- head(streamers[order(streamers$total_followers, decreasing = TRUE), ],5)
top_5

```


### 3.1 Creating a chart.


```{r}


chart_1 <- ggplot(top_5, 
  aes(x = reorder(channel, -total_followers), y = total_followers)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkslateblue", color = "gray10") +
  geom_text(aes(label = total_followers), vjust = -0.5, color = "white") +
  labs(title = "The total number of observations in the top 5 Twitch TV streamers",
       x = "Channel name",
       y = "The total number of observations") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "white"),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid = element_blank())

print(chart_1)


```


The chart presents a comparison of the top 5 streamers on the Twitch TV platform in terms of Total Followers. In the first place is Tfue, who has amassed nearly 9 million total followers. In the second position is shroud with over 7 million total followers. Following them are Myth, Rubius, and pokimane.


# 4. Watch Time - For The Top 5 Twitch TV Streamers.




I am narrowing down the dataset to the top 5 most popular streamers on the Twitch TV platform in terms of Watch Time.


```{r}

top_5_watch_time <- head(streamers[order(streamers$watch_time, decreasing = TRUE),],5)
top_5_watch_time

```
### 4.1 Creating a chart.

```{r}
chart_2 <- ggplot(top_5_watch_time, 
  aes(x = reorder(channel, -watch_time), y = watch_time)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkslateblue", color = "gray10") +
  geom_text(aes(label = watch_time), vjust = -0.5, color = "white") +
  labs(title ="Total viewing time for the top 5 Twitch TV streamers",
       x = "Channel name",
       y = "Total viewing time") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "white"),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid = element_blank())

print(chart_2)


```


A ranking of the top 5 streamers on the Twitch TV platform based on watch time.


# 5. Streaming language structure (creating a chart).

```{r}

language_counts <- table(streamers$language)

top_languages <- head(sort(language_counts, decreasing = TRUE), 3)

language_percentages <- prop.table(top_languages) * 100

my_colors <- c("darkslateblue", "palegreen", "firebrick")

par(
  bg = "gray20", 
    col.lab = "white", 
    col.main = "white")
pie(
  language_percentages, 
  labels = paste(names(language_percentages), 
  sprintf("%.1f%%", language_percentages)), 
  col = my_colors,
  main = "Structure of the Top 3 Languages (Percentage-wise)")




```




The chart depicts the structure of the top 3 languages used by the top 1000 streamers.

# 6. Followers Gained - For The Top 5 Twitch TV Streamers.


I am narrowing down the dataset to the top 5 most popular streamers on the Twitch TV platform in terms of Followers Gained.


```{r}

top_5_followers_gained <- head(streamers[order(streamers$followers_gained, decreasing = TRUE),],5)
top_5_followers_gained



```

### 6.1 Creating a chart.

```{r}

chart_3 <- ggplot(top_5_followers_gained, 
  aes(x = reorder(channel, -followers_gained), y = followers_gained)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkslateblue", color = "gray10") +
  geom_text(aes(label = followers_gained), vjust = -0.5, color = "white") +
  labs(title ="Total followers gained for the top 5 Twitch TV streamers",
       x = "Channel name",
       y = "Followers gained") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + theme_minimal() +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "white"),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid = element_blank())

chart_3

```
